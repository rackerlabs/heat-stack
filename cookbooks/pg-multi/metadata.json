The slave servers are configured by default into read-only mode.\n\nAttributes\n-----------\n\n`['pg-multi']['master']` : sets the IP address that defines the master node\n\n`['pg-multi']['slaves']` : is any array that defines the IP address(es) of\nthe slave node(s).\n\n`['pg-multi']['replication']['user']` : allows for the setting of a custom name for\nthe replication user, by default it is set to 'repl'.\n\n`['pg-multi']['replication']['password'] ` : allows for the setting of a custom password for the replication user.\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author:: Christopher Coffey (<christopher.coffey@rackspace.com>)\n\n```text\n\nCopyright:: 2014 Rackspace US, Inc\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Christopher Coffey","maintainer_email":"christopher.coffey@rackspace.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{},"dependencies":{"postgresql":">= 0.0.0","yum":">= 0.0.0","apt":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"version":"0.1.0"}
